						<h2>About the DB Browser Application</h2>
						<p>
							DBBrowser is a program which can be used to view the structure
							of databases as well as to run queries against them.  The
							program is written to work with as many RDBMS systems as
							possible, using the JDBC API.  Currently, the program supports
							connections to PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server 2000,
							and Oracle RDBMS systems.  The DBBrowser uses a plugin API to
							do this and can be made to connect to any other system for
							which a JDBC driver exists.  More information on how to do
							this will be written at a future time.  Until then, you may be
							able to use the generic JDBC plugin included in the DBBrowser
							release.  You are encouraged to contact the authors of this
							software for the source and/or an explaination of how a plugin
							can be created that meets your needs.

						<h2>Installing the DB Browser Application</h2>
						
						<h3>Installing Java</h3>
						<p>
							Note that the DBBrowser application requires the Java JRE
							version 1.4.0 or higher.  More info on how to obtain the JRE
							can be found at
							<a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a> or
							<a href="http://java.com/en/index.jsp">
							http://java.com/en/index.jsp</a>.
						</p>
						
						<h3>Installing DB Browser</h3>
						<p>
							These instructions indicate MS Windows style paths.  However,
							anyone using other OS's should be able to apply these
							instructions by altering the paths for their specific needs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unzip dbbrowser.zip and copy the dbbrowser directory into C:\Program Files, or any
							other location on your hard-drive where you want the program
							files to be stored.  The dbbrowser directory contains these
							files:
						</p>

						<ul class="no-bullets" id="file-list">
							<li>
								<h4>DBBrowser.exe</h4>
								<p>
									A windows executable which will run DBBrowser.
									You can easily create a Windows shortcut to this
									executable.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>dbbrowser.sh</h4>
								<p>
									A bash script to run the dbbrowser application.
									from within a unix environment.  (This script
									was tested on Linux and may require modifications
									for other unix variants.)
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>us.pcsw.dbbrowser.jar</h4>
								<p>JAR containing the dbbrowser application</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>us.pcsw.utillib.jar</h4>
								<p>
									JAR containing the PC Software utilities libarary.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>ui.jar</h4>
								<p>
									A library provided by Apple that provides OS X
									integration.  Because some of the interfaces in this
									library are implemented by DBBrowser classes, this
									library is needed even if you are running DBBrowser on
									non-Apple platforms.  I believe that I will be able
									to work around this dependency soon.  This archive is
									not needed by Mac OS X users as it comes with Apple's
									Java runtime.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Installing the JDBC Drivers</h3>
						<p>
							JDBC drivers for MSSQL 2000, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL are
							all included in the directory jdbc_drivers:
						</p>
						
						<ul class="no-bullets" id="driver-list">
							<li>
								<h4>mssql\</h4>
								<p>
									A directory containing Microsoft's MSSQL 2000 JDBC drivers.
								</p>
								<p class="annotation italic">
									<strong>NOTE</strong> There is an open source driver,
									available from http://jtds.sourceforge.net/ which
									allows connections to Microsoft SQL Server
									versions 6.5 to 2000.  However, I have not yet
									finished testing the driver with DB Browser.  It
									appears to work well enough except that the
									database metadata returned from it does not always
									produce the expected results; causing incorrect
									output in the DB structure viewer.  Our MSSQL
									driver does not yet support this driver, though
									the generic JDBC driver will.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>mysql_connector-java-3.0.8-stable-bin.jar</h4>
								<p>
									A JAR containing MySQL JDBC drivers.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>oracle\</h4>
								<p>
									A directory containing the two zip archives that are the
									Oracle JDBC drivers.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>pgjdbc2.jar</h4>
								<p>
									A JAR containing the PostgreSQL libraries.
								</p>
								<p class="annotation italic">
									<strong>NOTE</strong> Despite the fact that this driver
									will return a list of all available catalogs,
									it does not return metadata for objects within
									catalogs other than the one currently connected.
									Therefore, only the currently connected catalog is
									shown in the DB structure viewer.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Running DBBrowser for the First Time</h3>
						<p>
							The DB Browser tries to load application preferences from a
							file called .dbbrowser.cfg (the dot before dbbrowser.cfg is
							significant) located in the user's home directory.  If this
							file is not found, the application will fall back to
							reasonable defaults.  You may change these default settings.
							Do this by selecting the Edit->Preferences menu item.
						</p >
						<p>
							A quick note about the Cache size preference.  When a select
							statement is executed, the application only gets as many rows
							as this preference indicates; until more is needed.  For
							example, if the Cache size is set at 1000 (the default) and a
							query is run that contains 4000 rows, only the first 1000 rows
							will be loaded to start with.  After the user scrolls beyond
							the first 1000 rows, the next 1000 rows will be loaded; and so
							forth until all results are loaded.  In the preferences
							dialog, a slider indicates how many rows to Fetch (cache) at a
							time.  The two extremes, 0 and infinity do the same; all rows
							are cached.  For very large resultsets, this may cause a long
							period of time to pass before results are shown because of the
							time it takes to populate the results table.  Also this may
							cause larger amounts of memory to be used by DB Browser than
							what is needed.  As a general rule, it is wizer to use select
							statements with more limiting WHERE clauses whenever possible.
						</p >
						<h3>Final Notes</h3>
						<p>
							This application has been tested primarily on a Linux platform using
							Sun's Java 1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.5.0 runtimes.  However, I have
							tried to create an application that will be usefull for all
							platforms which have a Java runtime of version 1.4.0 or better.
							If you have any constructive suggestions on how I can make
							DB Browser better, please let me know.
						</p>
						<p>Enjoy!<br/>
