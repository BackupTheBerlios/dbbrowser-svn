			As of version 1.6.0, DBBrowser supports scripting using the
			<a href="http://beanshell.org">BeanShell</a> scripting engine.
			Beanshell is a scripting language based on Java.  Since it is
			based on Java (and runs in Java) it supports Objects.  Another
			feature that can make writing scripts quick and simple is loose
			typing.  Although strict typing and variable declaration is in
			BeanShell, it is not required.  All language constructs available
			to Java developers are available in the BeanShell language.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyone wishing to use scripting in DBBrowser should read the
			BeanShell documentation at
			<a href="http://beanshell.org/docs.html">
				http://beanshell.org/docs.html
			</a> in order to learn the scripting syntax.  The user's manual
			is well written and should be easy for most users to pick up.
			This is especially true if you already know java as BeanShell is
			based on java syntax.
		</p>
		<a href="#top">Back to the Top</a>
		<center><a name="why"><h2>Why Use BeanShell Scripting</h2></a></center>
		<p>
			Some database systems systems have extended SQL syntax that will
			allow developers to create scripts that include such useful
			language structures such as looping, decisions (if statements) and
			output.  Such an engine is MS SQL server.  Others, like
			PostgreSQL, have such constructs from within functions, but they
			can not be used for ad-hoc query statements such as one would run
			in DBBrowser.  Now that BeanShell scripting is provided in
			DBBrowser, you have that functionallity for any database which you
			can connect to with DBBrowser.  Imagine being able to run a query,
			inspect the results, make a decision based on those results, then
			selected another set of results to display (maybe even using the
			results of the first query in the construction of the second
			query).  Yes, it is true that such things can often be done using
			subselects and the smart use of joins.  However, this is only an
			example.  The complexity of the script is limited only by your own
			imagination.  You can create ad-hoc scripts that are just as
			complex as you wish.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another use for BeanShell scripting in DBBrowser is for exploring
			and testing JDBC drivers interactively.  Developers that are just
			starting with Java can use DBBrowser to interactively use jdbc
			commands and explore the library.  JDBC driver developers could
			use this functionallity to test their driver's capabilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			In a future version, I hope to add an <i>export</i> feature that
			will create a BeanShell script that can be run from the command
			line outside of the DBBrowser application.  Functionallity
			provided by DBBrowser to the BeanShell environment would be
			emulated so that any script run from within DBBrowser could be run
			without any special tools or packages.  What is this good for?
			Complex database changes for a software update.  Suppose you make
			changes into your software that requires major changes to the
			structure of the database, or even worse, the contents in certain
			tables.  DBBrowser could be used to author and test a script that
			contains all the changes.  The script could then be run at
			production sites to apply the changes.

		<center><a name="how"><h2>How to Use BeanShell Scripting</h2></a></center>
		<p>
			In order for DBBrowser to know that a statement is a script rather
			than a SQL statement, start the script with &quot;//bsh&quot;.
			Also, there are two pieces of functionality that DBBrowser
			provides beyond the standard BeanShell language.  The first is
			that before your script is run, there are some variables that will
			will be set and some commands will be installed in the scripting
			environment.  Your script will have access to them.
			<i>This list may be expanded in the future.</i>
		</p>
		<h3><a name="variables">Variables</a></h3>
			<h4>_dbbConnectionProvider</h4> This variable is an object from
				which a your script can get a java.sql.Connection.
			<h4>_dbbBeanShellSession</h4> This variable is there for the use
				of DBBrowser's built-in commands.  There are no properties or
				methods in this object of use to the user.
		<h3><a name="commands">Commands</a></h3>
			<h4>dbbPrintResult(java.sql.ResultSet)</h4> Will display the
				ResultSet in the output area of DBBrowser.  More than one
				resultset can be displayed.  <strong>Note:</strong> Unlike
				results of a SQL statement run directly by DBBrowser, results
				displayed by this command are not cached, but read in all at
				once.  For this reason, calling this command with large result
				sets could take a long time and cause DBBrowser to use larger
				amounts of memory.
			<h4>dbbPrintResult(java.sql.ResultSet, boolean)</h4> This
				command is just like dbbPrintResult(java.sql.ResultSet)
			    except that passing in <code>true</code> for the second
			    parameter will cause the resultset to be cached.
			    <strong>Note:</strong> This command is for future use and
			    should not be used yet.
		<h3><a name="examples">Examples</a></h3>
		<p>
			Below is a simple example that will get a connection, execute a
			query, then show the results in DBBrowser's display.  It does not
			accomplish anything that couldn't be accomplished by simply
			running the query in DBBrowser directly.  However, it should give
			you an idea of how to use the variables and commands provided by
			DBBrowser.
			<pre>
	//bsh
	print("Hello World!");
	
	con = _dbbConnectionProvider.getConnection();
	stmt = con.createStatement();
	qry = stmt.executeQuery("Select * from mytable;");
	dbbPrintResult(qry);
	qry.close();
	stmt.close();
	con.close();

	print("Done!");
			</pre>
		</p>

			The following example is much more complex and shows the power of
			scripting.  Suppose that you added a feature to some software
			where files are stored in a database as BLOBs.  The feature is
			used more often that you expected and you fear that the database
			may grow to be unreasonably large due to the files stored in it.
			To address this concern, you decide to move the data out of the
			database and store them on the server filesystem.  Here is a
			script that you might write to make the needed database changes.
			This script will:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Alter the table to create a field which will hold the
					file's path.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create a new file for each record and write the data to
					file.
				</li>
				<li>Update each record with the file path.</li>
				<li>Drop the BLOB column.</li>
			</ol>
			<pre>
	//bsh

	// This is an example script that will solve the hypothetical problem of
	// moving documents that has been stored as BLOBs in the database onto the
	// file system.  Each document can have multiple versions, so each version
	// is given a unique name.

	// *Note* java.io.* and java.util.* are already imported into BeanShell
	// scripts by default.


	// Get a connection to the database and create a statement object
	con = _dbbConnectionProvider.getConnection();
	stmt1 = con.createStatement();

	// Create a field called filepath to the documentversion table
	stmt1.executeUpdate("ALTER TABLE documentversion ADD COLUMN filepath VARCHAR(255);");

	// Create a prepared statement to use later
	stmt2 = con.prepareStatement("UPDATE documentversion SET filepath = ? WHERE documentid = ? and version = ? ;");

	// Get a list of all document versions
	qry = stmt1.executeQuery("Select documentid, version, docdata FROM documentversion;");

	// Loop through the results
	buff = new byte[1024];
	while (qry.next()) {
		// Write the data to file
		data = qry.getBytes(3);
		if (! qry.wasNull()) {
			filename = "/tmp/documents/" + UUID.randomUUID().toString();
			out = new FileOutputStream(new File(filename));
			outstream = new FileOutputStream(filename);
			outstream.write(data);
			outstream.close();
	
			// Update the row with the file's name
			stmt2.setString(1, filename);
			stmt2.setLong(2, qry.getLong(1));
			stmt2.setInt(3, qry.getInt(2));
			stmt2.executeUpdate();
		}
	}

	// Clean up the resultset and the update query
	qry.close();
	stmt2.close();

	// Drop the docdata column
	stmt1.executeUpdate("ALTER TABLE documentversion DROP COLUMN docdata;");

	// Do final cleanup
	stmt1.close();
	con.close();
			</pre>

			Below is another example script that is fairly complex.
			It was used to change ownership of database objects to
			the group app_admins.  Many objects had mistakenly been
			created by users without being given ownership to
			app_admins.  As a result, only the creator could alter
			or drop objects.  This script was used to fix that
			problem.  This script is PostgreSQL specific.
			<pre>
	//bsh

	// The purpose of this script locate all the tables, indexes, views, sequences,
	// and functions that belong to the current user and to reassign their
	// ownership to the group app_admins;

	// Prepare
	con1 = _dbbConnectionProvider.getConnection();
	con2 = _dbbConnectionProvider.getConnection();
	stmt1 = con1.createStatement();
	stmt2 = con2.createStatement();

	// Tables, Indexes, Views, and Sequences

	StringBuilder sql;
	String type, name;
