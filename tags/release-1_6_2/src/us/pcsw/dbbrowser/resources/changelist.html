			<center><h1>DBBrowser Change List</h1></center>
		</div>
		<a href="http://dbbrowser.berlios.de">Go to the DBBrowser Website</a>
		<div id="divx.x.x">
			<a id="vx.x.x"></a>
			<center><h2>Version x.x.x</h2></center>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Added a command line option (-s) that will run a bean
					shell script before DBBrowser is initialized.
				</li>
				<li>
					Fixed a bug where the resultset used by cached resultset
					table models where being closed prematurely.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="div1.6.0">
			<a id="v1.6.0"></a>
			<center><h2>Version 1.6.0</h2></center>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Scripting support was added.  Now, not only can you
					run SQL statements in DBBrowser, but also
					<a href="http://beanshell.org">BeanShell</a> scripts.  See
					<a href="scripting.html">the scripting manual pages</a>
					for more information.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="div1.5.2">
			<a id="v1.5.2"></a>
			<center><h2>Version 1.5.2</h2></center>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Fixed a bug in the statement history dialog where the
					close button did not close the dialog.
				</li>
				<li>
					More bugfixes in the import tool.  It seems to be stable
					now, but could still use a good bit of real-world testing.
					I would like to add support for more file formats in a
					future version.
 				</li>
				<li>
					Added support for exporting query results into Microsoft
					Excel format thanks to use of the
					<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/">poi library</a>.
 				</li>
 			</ul>
 		</div>
		<div id="div1.5.1">
			<a id="v1.5.1"></a>
			<center><h2>Version 1.5.1</h2></center>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Fixed a bug where an error was thrown when loading
					connection setting that has a parameters with no value.
 				</li>
 			</ul>
 		</div>
		<div id="div1.5.0">
			<a id="v1.5.0"></a>
			<center><h2>Version 1.5.0</h2></center>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Fixed a bug where an error is sometimes thrown when the
					user attempts to open an SQL script file.
				</li>
				<li>
					Added support for SSL when making connections to
					PostgreSQL databases.  When the PostgreSQL provider is
					selected, there is a new database connection parameter
					called &quot;SSL Options&quot;.  The option &quot;Do Not
					Use SSL&quot; is the default option.  When this is
					selected, SSL will not be used.  The next option,
					&quot;Use SSL And Verify Certificate&quot; will force the
					use of SSL and the server's certificate will be verified
					with the appropriate certificate authority.  The last
					option, &quot;Use SSL And Do Not Verify Certificate&quot;
					will force the use of SSL, but the server's certificate
					will not be verified.  This is not as secure as verifying
					the certificate.  However, it can be useful if the client
					machine does not have internet access or the server is
					using a self-signed certificate (presumably for testing,
					not production).
				</li>
				<li>
					The schema for the XML document used to store connection
					provider parameters was changed in order to support the
					new PicklistConnectionParameter type.  DBBrowser is
					backwards compatible and can read the old connection
					provider files, but will use the new schema when writing
					new ones.
				</li>
				<li>
					A new subclass of connection parameter,
					PicklistConnectionParameter was created.  This new
					subclass can be used by connection providers to query the
					user for a selection from within a defined set of options.
					The options are shown in a combo box or a list, depending
					on whether multiple selections are allowed.
				</li>
				<li>
					Updated the version of the JTDS JDBC driver packaged with
					DBBrowser to version 1.0.3 from 0.5.1.  Version 1.0.3 is
					quite good and has been set to be used by default rather
					than Microsoft's driver.  As a result, DBBrowser should
					now support Microsoft SQL Server versions 6.5 and later.
					(Microsoft's driver only supports versions 2000 and later)
					It has been reported by users that DBBrowser supports
					Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 well using this driver.  However,
					Support of versions prior to 2000 has not been tested by
					PCSW.us.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bugfixes in the importer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Changed the import tool to use the ostermillerutils.jar
					library for parsing CSV files.  This gives far better
					support than Java's StreamTokenizer class.
				</li>
				<li>
					Added this change list and a menu option in the help
					menu from which the user may access it.
				</li>
